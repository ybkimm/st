About this fork
---------------
This fork contains few changes that focus on Korean users... and me.

It's dangerous to go alone! Take these:

* D2Coding (https://github.com/naver/d2codingfont)


Changes
-------

* Font has been changed to D2Coding
* Add scollback (https://st.suckless.org/patches/scrollback)


st - simple terminal
--------------------
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.


Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.
